 I want you to build a simple quiz program. It will ask a series of questions and evaluate each answer.

1- The program should keep track of the number of questions answered correctly.

2- After all the questions are answered the program should display the number of questions that were correctly answered.

3- And the number that the player got wrong.

4- You should use a two dimensional array to hold the questions and the answers.

5- Each element of the array represents one question and is itself an array composed of two elements: the question and the answer.

Create a two dimensional array with at least three questions in it.

You'll need to use a loop to cycle through each question.

Ask it, and compare the response from the player to the answer in the array.

You can use the prompt method to ask the question.

You'll then use a conditional statement to see if the player's answer matches the real answer.

When the loop is done, you should know how many questions were correctly answered.

6- So print that out to the screen.
